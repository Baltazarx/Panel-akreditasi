# Backend Import Issues Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Problem
The backend server was crashing with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors because several route files were importing from incorrectly named controller files.

### Files Fixed

1. **Backend/src/routes/tabel2cBentukPembelajaran.route.js**
   - ❌ Was importing: `bentukPembelajaran.controller.js`
   - ✅ Now imports: `tabel2cBentukPembelajaran.controller.js`

2. **Backend/src/routes/tabel2cFleksibilitasPembelajaran.route.js**
   - ❌ Was importing: `fleksibilitasPembelajaran.controller.js`
   - ✅ Now imports: `tabel2cFleksibilitasPembelajaran.controller.js`

3. **Backend/src/routes/tabel2dRekognisiLulusan.route.js**
   - ❌ Was importing: `rekognisiLulusan.controller.js`
   - ✅ Now imports: `tabel2dRekognisiLulusan.controller.js`

4. **Backend/src/routes/tabel2dSumberRekognisi.route.js**
   - ❌ Was importing: `sumberRekognisi.controller.js`
   - ✅ Now imports: `tabel2dSumberRekognisi.controller.js`

## Next Steps

Now the backend should start properly. Try running:

```bash
cd Backend
npm run dev
```

The server should start without errors and be ready to accept connections from the frontend.

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. Backend should start successfully on port 3000
2. Frontend should be able to connect to the backend
3. Test login functionality
4. Check that API endpoints respond correctly

## Additional Notes

All other controller imports were already correct and don't need changes.
